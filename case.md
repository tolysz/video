The case

Everything you do can be done in Haskell

I do not want to argue that one developer is better than all others put together.

I will not argue that you can use haskell everywhere.

Simply
I will not continue,
Sure, haskell is difficult and takes years to learn.

The main advantage is re-usability, and modularity.

It really shines with streaming services if you need to transform data or share state between connections or you require very low latency and throughput.

I am not making case that everyone can develop thus it is easy to replace people which go.

It forces to think in terms of what is required and what is desired.
This can be achieved in most other languages, even PHP - and it is called programming according to a specific interface.


For Haskell teams are usually small, and they members can develop different parts of the same apps in parallel.
Integration is usually simple, code does not degrade over time.

But as with anything, this is not a case what the language can do; but what a programmer says.

With haskell it is very easy to use binary, text, or whatever.

Using Haskell usually requires formal education/ people are constantly exposed to thinking in terms of data structures and algorithms.

I am not threatening to leave, as I already submitted my notice.

If you have a system which is not functioning and would have to be rewritten to fix it; maybe it is a case for.

My suggestion is to rewrite it as API; and as AngularJS app.

My currently relevant skills.
 Backend API
 AngularJS

Data analysis / Big data.

Parsing ( adapting for most formats ).
